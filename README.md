# Mini-project IV

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
In this project, my main goal is to understand how different characteristics play a role in the approval or rejection of a loan application. 

## Hypothesis
I believe that urban or suburban applicants with high levels of total income will be more likely to be granted a loan. 

## EDA 
Through modelling, I found that total applicant income bore alot of weight in predicting the status of the loan application while property are was not nearly as successful in correctly predicting the rejection/approval of an application. 


## Process

1. Hypothesis Generation – understanding the problem better by brainstorming possible factors that can impact the outcome
2. Data Exploration – looking at categorical and continuous feature summaries and making inferences about the data.
3. Data Cleaning – imputing missing values in the data and checking for outliers
4. Feature Engineering – modifying existing variables and creating new ones for analysis
5. Model Building – making predictive models on the data

## Results/Demo
(fill in your model's performance, details about the API you created, and (optional) a link to an live demo)

## Challanges 
One major challenge that I faced was being able to deploy the model I developed onto the cloud and being able to access it through a browser. I was able to get it to post onto an http address but when running that address on the browser it was stuck on a loading cycle. 

## Future Goals
In the future, I would definitely spend a lot more time interacting with and workshopping different ways to deploy models like Postman, AWS, python, etc.
